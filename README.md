# PID service (under development)


This repository provides a service for managing Permanent URLs (PURLs). We use per-directory Apache configuration files (.htaccess files) to redirect PURL requests to their real locations on the Web. 

## Status
The service is under development.

# Adding / Updating PURLs

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/saidfathalla/PID_repo/issues/new) describing the change you require.

2. Fork this repository and make a pull request to update your changes.
